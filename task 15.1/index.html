        //the bugs were in line 12 & line 19 
        // i used breakpoints to find the bugs
        // the veriable sum was a const and was assigned the value of 0 so when we wrote sum += arr1[i] it took it
        //reassigning/declaring sum witch is not possible due to it being a const.
        // the code was also missing a return statement.

        //the fixed code still returns not a number
        //please note thati solved the task from my understanding of js so far
